Simple log filtering utility.

School Purpose Only.

## Overview

Loglite is a polished educational cybersecurity utility by LayerByte. It focuses on one practical defensive concept and keeps the implementation small enough for students to read, run, and understand.

A lightweight log filter is useful for quick classroom exercises and small troubleshooting sessions.

## Highlights

- Filters logs simply
- Prints matched context
- Keeps behavior easy to inspect

## Feature Set

- Clear command-line or local application workflow
- Beginner-readable validation and error handling
- Copy-friendly output for notes, screenshots, and reports
- Conservative behavior designed around local or authorized data
- No exploit code, malware behavior, credential theft, brute forcing, or destructive actions

## Supported Inputs

- Text logs
- Search terms or simple filters

## Requirements

- Lua 5.4 or newer

## Installation

Clone the repository and open the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LayerByte/loglite.git
cd loglite
```

Then prepare the project with the standard toolchain:

```bash
lua -v
```

## Usage

Start with the help command or the default run command:

```bash
lua main.lua --help
```

## Example Workflow

1. Open the project folder.
2. Run the help command.
3. Provide a small authorized sample input.
4. Review the report and compare it with the source code.

Example run:

```bash
lua main.lua --help
```

## Expected Output

Matching log lines with concise summary information.

Output is intended to be readable in the terminal or application window and easy to copy into a school report or defensive analysis note.

## Safety Scope

- Use only on systems, files, domains, and data you own or have permission to inspect.
- Treat paths, hostnames, hashes, and log entries as potentially sensitive before sharing output.
- Prefer small sample files when learning how the tool works.
- Do not use the project for unauthorized scanning, exploitation, credential attacks, persistence, evasion, or destructive activity.

## Learning Goals

- Practice safe input validation and graceful error messages.
- Understand the defensive concept behind the tool.
- Learn how a focused security utility is organized in Lua.
- Compare raw input with structured output.
- Build habits around permission, documentation, and responsible testing.

## Development Notes

Keep modules small, return useful validation errors, and keep dependencies minimal.

Suggested checks before publishing changes:

```bash
# Run the help command.
# Test with a small non-sensitive sample.
# Confirm errors are clear when input is missing or invalid.
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the command is not found, confirm the required toolchain is installed and available in your PATH.
- If a file cannot be opened, check the path, permissions, and whether another program is locking it.
- If a network-focused check fails, verify the hostname, scheme, connection, and permission to test that endpoint.
- If output looks empty, retry with a smaller known-good sample input.

## Known Limitations

- Built for education and small authorized workflows, not enterprise monitoring.
- Results depend on operating system permissions, platform APIs, and sample quality.
- Some advanced features are intentionally omitted to keep the code approachable.
- Findings should be reviewed by a human before making security decisions.
